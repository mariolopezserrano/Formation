# Exercise 1

## Context:

You are working for BeeBox, a company that provides regular shipments of bees to costumer. The company is in the process
of building a kubernetes-based infrastructure.

Developers frequently request that you provide information from kubernetes cluster, so **you would like to give them the
ability to read data from cluster but not make any changes to it**.

**Using k8s RBAC ensure the dev user can read pod metadata and container logs from any pod in the beebox-mobile 
namespace**.

1) Create a role for the dev user.
2) Bind the role to dev user and verify your setup works.



### 1) Create a role for the dev user.
