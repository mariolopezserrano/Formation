# Kubernetes Api Groups and Versions

Kubernetes organizes its API into different groups based on their purpose. These groups hold various resources related
to specific themes.

The two main types of groups are de **core** group and **named** groups. The core group contains fundamental resources
essential to the platform's operation (Pods, Nodes, Namespaces, Services.)

Named groups allows you to extend kubernetes functionality by introducing custom resources and controllers related to
specific areas like networking and storage.
